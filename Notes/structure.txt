Flask Blueprints
----------------
-> Makes view referencing easier
-> Registers a url_prefix for each views.py
-> blueprints are registered in the init.py file


-> Blueprints are stored in the views.py file
-> "from flask import Blueprint"

-> ex: var = Blueprint('owners',__name__,template_folder="templates/directory")
  @blueprint_var.route('/file',methods=[])

-> Blueprints are imported into the __init__.py file
-> Blueprints are then registered in the init file, with corresponding directories
